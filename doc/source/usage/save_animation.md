Render and Save Animation
==============

## Render the environment

You can render the environment by calling the [env.render()](#irsim.env.env_base.EnvBase.render) function and change the arguments of this function to control the rendering of each frame. The main parameters are:

- **`interval`:** The time interval between frames. Default 0.05. This parameter is used to control the speed of visualization.
- **`figure_kwargs`:** The parameters of the figures. Such as the transparent, bbox_inches, dpi, etc. Default {}. See [savefig](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.savefig.html) for more details.
- **`kwargs`:** These additional parameters are passed to the all the [object.plot](#irsim.world.object_base.ObjectBase.plot) function for default settings. 

## Save the animation as GIF file

You can save the animation of the simulation as a gif file very easily by setting the `save_ani` to `True` in the `make()` function:

```python

env = irsim.make(save_ani=True)

for i in range(300):

    env.step()
    env.render(0.05)

    if env.done():
        break

env.end(ending_time=3)
```

`ending_time` denotes how long the figure will be closed. The animation generation is also performed in this `env.end()` function. You can set the additional arguments in this function to control the animation generation. Details of the parameters can be found in the [env.end()](#irsim.env.env_base.EnvBase.end). 

Some common parameters for `GIF` format you may use are: 

- **`loop`:** The number of times the GIF should loop. Default 0 (meaning loop indefinitely).
- **`duration `:** The duration (in seconds) of each frame. Either specify one value that is used for all frames, or one value for each frame. 
- **`fps`:** The number of frames per second. If duration is not given, the duration for each frame is set to 1/fps. Default 10.
- **`subrectangles `:** If True, will try and optimize the GIF by storing only the rectangular parts of each frame that change with respect to the previous. Default True.

The principle of the animation generation is to save the images of each frame and then combine them into a gif file.

## Save the animation as a video

You can save the animation of the simulation as a video file such as mp4 file by setting the suffix of the file to `.mp4` in the [env.end()](#irsim.env.env_base.EnvBase.end) function. Please make sure you have the `ffmpeg` installed in your system by `pip install imageio[ffmpeg]`. The example is shown below:

```python 

env = irsim.make(save_ani=True)

for i in range(300):

    env.step()
    env.render(0.05)

    if env.done():
        break

env.end(ending_time=3, suffix='.mp4')
```

More `suffix` for the animation file format can be found on [imageio docs](https://imageio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/formats/video_formats.html)

## 3D Plot

You can simply set the `projection` parameter to `3d` in `irsim.make` function to render the 3D plot of the simulation. The example is shown below:

```python

env = irsim.make(projection='3d')

for i in range(300):

    env.step()
    env.render(0.05)

    if env.done():
        break

env.end(3)
```

```{image} gif/3d_plot.gif
:alt: Select Parameters
:width: 400px
:align: center
```

:::{note}
Currently, the 3D plot only visualizes the 2D objects in the 3D space. The 3D objects are not supported yet.
